Slug: old-little-boys

Behold the well-dressed worm  
all day but lacking night  
has to twist and squirm  
for my words nip and bite  
  
Thief and lying schemer  
insists on his facade  
Peter Pan the dreamer  
can't fly near sons of God  
  
Mr Class and Quality  
moves about his pawns  
pied-piper riffs on mutiny;  
a whistleblower spawns  
  
Cold dead-handed senators  
tally another notch  
patient youth find open doors  
by looking at their watch  
  
Greedy princeling owner:  
“without me you will starve!”  
Diogenes the loner  
crawls back inside his jar  
  
Old little boys  
treat people like their toys  
but look what happens when  
they encounter men
