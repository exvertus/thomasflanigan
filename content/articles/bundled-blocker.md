Entangled web of black lines  
on each path where I won't go  
the grabbing possessing gropes  
of shadowy near-drownings  
  
A hopeless task for a day  
pull on a loop  
does it unwind?  
Will it give yet?  
Another first?  
  
Fingers must reach  
where no light digs  
as each dark strand  
become guideropes
