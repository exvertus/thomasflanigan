Reaching further inward  
he stretched his eyes  
to the mirror at the center  
under the second dome  
Delighting in his delphic duty  
he reaches for his glimpse  
but it is both too high  
and too deep  
  
He seeks a definition  
in the image painted at the intersection  
of infinite darkness and light  
The mirror will deliver its truth  
with its own hidden agenda  
it shatters into a glittery dust  
before he can steal his glance  
  
He dances in the silver snow  
peering into the tiny mirrors  
to solve the impossible mystery  
of being and not being
