They tick-tock a different way  
I thought I was unique  
But just a simple freak  
  
I was made as incomplete  
Did they forget a soul?  
Does my heart have a hole?  
  
A wavelength I cannot see  
A frequency I cannot hear  
They live and breath in ways I can't  
Observer not participant  
  
Why should they change for my sake?  
I can't be so outspoken  
When I'm the one that's broken  
  
If I were you, I'd hate me too  
My list of failures long  
I'm not sure what went wrong  
  
A wavelength I cannot see  
A frequency I cannot hear  
On borrowed time, my life on lease  
How can I find my missing piece?
