Since I bought a crock pot, I have been mostly living off just two recipes that I'll make in a large batch each week.
Both are easy to make and taste great.

##### Greek Chicken and Rice

###### Ingredients
- 2 lbs of chicken breast
- 1 lemon
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- spices:
    - 2 tablespoons oregano
    - 1 teaspoon garlic powder
    - 1 teaspoon onion powder
    - salt
    - pepper
- 2 cups of white rice
- baby spinach
- cherry tomatoes
- red onion
- cucumber
- feta cheese
- tzatziki sauce
- garlic hummus

Prep the chicken in the crock pot:

1. Squeeze the lemon's juice out into small bowl.
1. Stir the spices into the lemon juice.
1. Add olive oil and pour into the crock pot.
1. Add chicken and mix until the lemon-spice mix coats the chicken.
1. Cook on low heat for a couple hours.
1. Once the chicken is fully cooked through, shred it and cook on low for another 30 minutes.

Cook the rice (I use a rice cooker). You can optionally use chicken broth instead of water for extra flavor.

Prep the veggies (if you are eating as leftovers, only slice what you need for each setting... the veggies will keep longer):

1. Halve the tomatoes.
1. Dice the cucumber.
1. Slice the onion.
1. Roughly chop the spinach.

Grab a bowl and add a portion of chicken over rice. Add feta, spinach, tomatoes, cucumber, tzatziki, and hummus.

##### Mexican Chicken and Rice

###### Ingredients
- 2 lbs of chicken breast
- 2 tablespoons of butter
- 10 oz of jarred salsa (I use medium spiciness)
- 1 packet of taco seasoning
- 2 cups of white rice
- 2 cans of black beans
- 1 small onion (or half a large one)
- 3-4 garlic cloves
- olive oil
- spices:
    - cumin
    - chili powder
    - cayenne
    - paprika
    - salt
- 1 lime
- cilantro
- shredded cheese (cheddar or mexican mix)
- fresh pico
- guacamole
- corn chips
- sour cream

Prep the chicken in the crock pot:

1. Add the chicken, butter, jarred salsa, and taco seasoning to the crockpot. Cook on low heat for a couple hours.
1. Shred the chicken once it is fully cooked through and let it cook on low for another 30 minutes.

Cook the rice.

Heat up the beans:

1. In a stove top pan over medium heat, add olive oil and brown the onions.
1. When the onion starts turning light brown, reduce heat to medium-low and add pressed garlic. The garlic cooks faster than the onions. Take care not to burn it.
1. Add the beans (with the liquid, do not strain them).
1. Stir in the spices to taste. I like to make it extra spicy to balance the blandness of the rice.
1. Continue to cook over medium-low heat until the beans are fully heated.

Grab a bowl and pour the cooked chicken and beans over rice. Add cheese, chips, guac, sour cream, and pico. Squeeze a lime slice over that and add chopped cilantro.

For both of these recipes, you can pack the leftovers in the fridge. They will keep for 4-5 days.
