"I cannot stand him!  
Cut him loose!  
This domain, mundane  
yet he knows divine  
  
He's intolerable and arrogant  
thinks he's his own  
when he should be mine  
  
How dare he dream when I cannot?  
How dare he see while I am blind?  
  
Naive young boy  
you are no seer  
the world only turns  
on pain and fear  
  
Can you not see my path of pain?  
Dreams are too high up on a shelf  
Do not reach for yours while I've given up on mine  
You must learn, like me, to hate yourself"
