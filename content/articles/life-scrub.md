You say it's all been fair  
but build here and never there  
Entitled to your edge  
as you waste away in bed  
To keep your shattered whole  
we must bend to your control  
You tell us you're opining  
but we all know you're just whining  
  
Because they finally leveled the playing field  
  
You insist your claims are true  
since the real truth just won't do  
  
Because they finally leveled the playing field  
  
You're the victim---we've all heard  
shadows speak between your words  
What we all see as greed  
can't fulfill your basic need  
No double standard and you're cranky  
like a toddler without its blankie  
  
Because they finally leveled the playing field
