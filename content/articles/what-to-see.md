Slug: what-to-see

There they stand  
before me  
at all waking hours  
peering through the window to my soul  
  
What makes them stop?  
What makes them pause?  
What is it about me?  
that stirs their soul enough  
that the gnawing fugue which keeps them scurrying about  
is drowned out for a brief moment  
by the fully summoned orchestra?  
  
And when was it that I stopped asking  
‘What is it about me?’ instead of ‘why not?’  
  
?  
  
Why not these others?
  
Why not she to my left?  
For she silently breathes  
and takes all her meals  
through the roof and her leaves  
  
Why not he to my right?  
Utilitarian dream  
ever watchful eye  
with interface and screen  
  
Why not those in the center?  
What was it they saw  
as they exchanged windows themselves  
without showing their awe?  
  
sigh.  
  
Then one day  
before me  
a different sort of day  
small ones that did not look my way  
  
They stopped for trees  
inspected machines  
Yet still I remain  
flat image in frame  
They see me as a drop in their dazzling ocean  
but there are brief moments  
where old envious scolds teach the young conductor  
that to perfect the symphony they must banish all musicians  
  
.  
  
Now I know  
with a gaze so free  
they don’t look right left inward  
but stay fixated on me  
I stir in for a moment  
The thing they used to be  
Before the yoke rode blood-striped backs  
with eyes taught not to see
