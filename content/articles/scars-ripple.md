A wretched fear defeated,  
a monster laid to rest.  
From victory, new sanctity,  
a home in Edenâ€™s garden;  
flowers from the ashes of pain  
sheltered by walls of never forget.  

Again darkness chokes beauty;  
rigid grasps fell stars like sand.  
The farm lay barren and wild calls.  
Gods cast long shadows,  
to hide their demons.  
Consumed again, the old enemy smiles...
