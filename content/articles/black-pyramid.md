A little boy finds a land marker  
a miniature pyramid of polished obsidian  
upon touching it  
his hopeless stuttering is instantly cured
  
He plays with his twin sister  
in the comfort that the hearth watches  
the bricks of the fireplace  
tear open like a curtain
the tall obsidian bug-man silently emerges  
watching with his large lizard eyes  
he is accompanied by his familiar  
the gnome-shade of impish intricacies  
  
The children see their own reflection in the obsidian  
just as they do in the glossy black phone screen when it is finally turned off  
when the black mirror becomes the only company left
  
The naked adults chained to the back wall are horrified  
but the children are not afraid  
they know the pyramid is bigger than the largest at Giza  
it only appears miniature because it is buried
buried under the manicured english lawn
