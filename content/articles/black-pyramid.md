A little boy finds a land marker  
a miniature pyramid of polished obsidian  
upon touching it  
he is instantly cured of his speech impediment  
  
The boy plays with his sister  
in the comfort that the hearth watches  
from the fireplace  
a split in the wall  
the tall obsidian bug-man silently appears  
watching with his large lizard eyes  
he is accompanied by his familiar  
the gnome-shade of impish intricacies  
  
They see their own reflection in their skin  
just as they do in the glossy black of the television when it is finally turned off  
when the black mirror is all that's left  
  
The naked adults chained to the back wall are horrified  
but the children are not afraid  
they know the pyramid is the same size as the largest at Giza  
it only appears miniature because it is buried in the landscaped yard
