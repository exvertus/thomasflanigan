This power plug knew it was different  
  
While the other plugs easily fit into sockets  
this one did not  
It always needed some kind of adapter  
Simply to be functional  
  
It asked itself "what is wrong with me?"  
"Why can't I fit like the others?"  
It started to suspect  
that it might be defective  
  
"If I was designed correctly,  
I would not need an adapter to connect  
like the others"  
  
But when they arrived in a new land  
the roles reversed  
and the misfit could finally work natively
