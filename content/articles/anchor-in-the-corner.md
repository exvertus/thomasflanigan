Over and over  
you have to look  
have to ponder  
have to wonder  
  
What are they doing?  
Why must I know?  
Who is this person?  
How do they stand out by staying hidden?  
  
The risks you will not take  
the lonely wait for the hero  
They are lion, they are lamb  
they are the entire forest  
  
The adventure you seek  
is exploring their endless mystery  
Arresting with a glance  
a glimpse into another universe
