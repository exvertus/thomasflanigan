Slug: invaders

A man of buried legions  
became possessed one day  
A legionnaire took control  
because he wanted to be seen  
  
Some of them thought  
'We live in a vast kingdom'  
Others claimed there is no kingdom  
  
They settled the debate with a wager:  
march the army forward  
and see how far they get  
  
They marched on a small neighboring lord  
This lord did not know his kingdom's edge either  
But he knew his inner gates were his  
  
The invading force was defeated  
But their king thought he had already fought the same battle and won  
Perhaps he had only dreamt it
