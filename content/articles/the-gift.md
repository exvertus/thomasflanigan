When hopeless home  
maternal split  
almost feral  
emphemeral edge  
  
Reminds the soul  
havles to the whole  
when connection sparked  
complete circle:  
I am me  
  
Foundational completion  
the primary return  
this door is just the way i entered  
through you was how I'm born  
  
Without it closed  
demons lurk  
and seek to rampage through minds  
  
Eve see  
so you don't fail  
You are the earth  
but not the tree  
  
If not in truth  
your love is the noose
