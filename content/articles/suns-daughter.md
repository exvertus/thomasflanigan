In the industrial garden  
under the dome of ivory  
often times the candlelight will dim and flicker  
it is choked at the breast  
and deprived of its breath  
  
But when the dome moves back  
cradled by the green hand  
it can never become  
"nothing will ever be enough"  
because we cannot run out  
exploring the prints on her fingers
