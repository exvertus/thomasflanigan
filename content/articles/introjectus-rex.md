Slug: introjectus-rex

With her grip of iron  
She still held his loins  
  
Every time he reached  
to sever the second umbilical cord  
she would step on his testicles  
  
So everyone he meets  
must become her second version  
  
He finds religion  
in the embodiment of the strength he lacks  
  
Fantasy comes first  
the front porch of his mind  
is a factory for making adjustments  
alterations, hemming, patching  
  
"Do not let things of this world in  
before they are made to perfectly fit  
my flawless image"  
  
Convinced he was walking in their shoes  
he thought he discovered all there was to them  
but the dialogue was always really monologue  
  
He never knew anyone  
and so he will never know himself  
Mother taught him well
