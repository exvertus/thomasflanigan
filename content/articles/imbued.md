A follower told me to preserve an item  
'A signed copy must maintain its mint condition'  
The man who created it was thought to be great  
but it would later become clear he was merely a wretch  
  
Now the copy was worn and tattered  
but when its owner passed it sold at auction  
and for a considerable sum  
It was coveted yet again  
not for its content  
nor author  
nor signature  
  
The man who made it worn was thought to be great
