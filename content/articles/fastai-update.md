I've been working through [fastai's course](https://course.fast.ai/) and recently trained two image classifiers to put the concepts into practice.

The [first model](https://huggingface.co/spaces/exvertus/fastat-guitar-classifier) identifies one of four classic guitar models from a photo. [Here's the code](https://github.com/exvertus/fastai-coursework/tree/main/two/guitars).

My second project is a [season classifier](https://huggingface.co/spaces/exvertus/fastai-season-guesser), which predicts the season in a landscape image. The project code is available [here](https://github.com/exvertus/fastai-coursework/tree/main/one/seasons).

These projects were fun and a lot easier than I expected to code and deploy a working model.
I have quite a few ideas for future work and am looking forward to more machine learning projects.
