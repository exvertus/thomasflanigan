With a degree in music, I began my tech career as a development programmer after teaching myself Python through [MIT's Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm).
I later became interested in tools like Jenkins and took on a more devops-focused role and am currently architecting and supporting a continuous integration system running on Kubernetes.
See more about my professional experience on my [resume](/resume).

I am also a classical pianist that has played guitar and bass in bands, currently producing an [electronic soundtrack](https://materialsoul.bandcamp.com/album/roze-blud-original-soundtrack-prerelease) for the upcoming game [Roze Blud](https://rozeblud.com/).
I also enjoy art and have taken up ink-drawing recently. You can follow me on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tomisdrawingagain/).
