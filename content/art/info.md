Title: Info

I drew a lot until the age of 14, when I began to hate my pencil drawings...
it wasn't until 20 years later that I picked up a pack a Sakura fine-liners to mitigate lockdown boredom.
I have fallen in love with the sharper line-art results.
  
I do a bit of realism, mostly botanicals.
I love drawing the flowers that grow locally here in Central Texas.
  
But surrealism is my main jam these days.
When I started drawing using psychic automatic techniques, 
I quickly found myself in touch with a rich, deep and strange dreamworld just beyond my conscious awareness.
Most nights before bed I try to draw in a half-awake state into the wee hours of the morning,
doing my best to transfer whatever wants to come out onto the page.
