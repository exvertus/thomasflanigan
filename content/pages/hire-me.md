## Experienced DevOps and Application Security Professional Seeking Remote Opportunities

### Who I Am

I'm Tom Flanigan, a seasoned software developer with a strong focus on DevOps and application security. For over a decade, I've led critical initiatives in SDLC automation, cloud-based infrastructure, and proactive security strategies. 
My passion lies in enhancing team efficiency and fostering a culture of innovation and continuous improvement. 

If you'd like to learn more about me personally and where I'm currently at in life, see my [recent blog post](/finding-my-ikigai.html).

### What I Bring

- Technical Expertise: Proficient in Python, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform, Terraform, and more. I have a continuous appetite for learning and consistently expand my skill set.
- DevOps & Automation: Led the architecture and management of CI/CD pipelines and cloud infrastructure, driving efficiency and reliability.
- Security & Compliance: Specialized in supply chain security, vulnerability management, and automated testing, ensuring robust security across projects.
- Leadership: Experienced working with cross-functional teams, mentoring developers, and implementing best practices in Agile and Scrum environments.

### What I’m Looking For

- Role: I’m best-suited to roles that allow me to apply my DevOps and security expertise, but am open-minded about pivoting into adjacent roles.
- Culture: I thrive in environments that value genuineness, ethical leadership, and building trust through mutual respect.
- Location: Seeking a US-based remote role, with no in-office or hybrid expectations.

### Non-Negotiables

- Work-Life Balance or Work-Life Alignment: I value either a relaxed work environment that allows time for creative passions, or a more demanding role that aligns closely with my personal interests, such as roles that intersect with art or music.
- Compensation: Competitive salary offers are important. While salary ranges significantly below industry standards are not automatically disqualified, they should be balanced with sufficient compensatory benefits.
