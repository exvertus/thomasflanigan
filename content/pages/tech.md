### Development, Automation, Cloud, and Security

In my tech journey spanning over a decade, I've evolved from app development, through the intricacies of SDLC automation and cloud engineering, to the challenges of app security. What sets me apart is not just my aptitude for developing automated solutions, but my commitment to mentoring the next wave of tech professionals. Having spearheaded pivotal projects with a keen eye on eradicating technical debt, I'm drawn to the symbiotic relationship between enhancing software security and optimizing development.
