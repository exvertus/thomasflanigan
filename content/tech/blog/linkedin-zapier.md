I recently configured a bit of personal automation for myself,
and if you arrived here via my blogpost share on LinkedIn,
you've already seen what it does.
TODO: Need better hook here.
I wanted to not only share with you how I did it with Zapier,
but also why I am so excited that accessibility to small-scale 
software automation is now becoming a reality.

### Why automate?

As someone with a more than a few absent-minded-professor tendencies,
I knew that posting to my LinkedIn manually would quickly fall to pieces.
While things like avoiding manual errors and not having to remember each time are welcome benefits, I always like to emphasize my biggest reason for automating:

*the less something costs to create, the more it will be produced.*

While few will disagree in theory with that statement,
the temptation to discard it in practice is very real.
I admit I 'kick the can' too often myself 
(the current state of some of my site's code provides a case-in-point), 
but when each productive iteration requires an arduous process that is left unchecked, a feeling of dread begins to get coupled to the creation process.
It can become so internalized that it is shrugged off as an "given" to producing whatever could come next.

This can quickly give rise to a lethargic creative depression:
new ideas increasingly fall under the shadow of 'too much of a bother'.
Much has already been said about the friction technical debt creates in a corporate setting and the stand-stills it can usher in if not take seriously.
I do not want to dismiss that debate as much as stay focused on something much closer to my heart of late---enabling automation for the individual.

A proliferation of automation accessibility can solve some big problems we didn't even know we had, but I will speak to that broader point after I show you how automation has helped me personally solve a more concrete automation problem: sharing to my LinkedIn each time I publish a new post so I don't have to manually.

### How it is usually done

linkedIn API, prefer client/wrapper in python
super-old repo
newer repo but doesn't have share option because of backend implementation
really nothing else? expand scope before making my own wrapper and client

### Discovering Zapier

TODO: what does sharing the Zap do?
Share how-to and that you had to adjust plugin for RSS
Easy to configure and test with real data

### Automation Democratization? It's *about time*...

...and not just about saving people it. It's about time because of all beautiful things that we have to give each other that we've all been missing out on...

I'll repeat the axiom I opened with here: *the less something costs to create, the more it will be produced*.

For those that share my interest in economics, you may draw some parallels
between other statements like "if you want more of something, subsidize it" and
"if you want less of something, tax it". 
You may also recall the similar price-control phenomenon,
where price-caps can lead to shortages and price-floors can lead to surpluses.

artists left behind when it comes to automation
applies to ALL 1-person businesses and side-hustles
where is the market for this?

 but getting back to my own needs, I went through the initial trouble of automating my site's build,
deployment, and follow-up-on-LinkedIn notification step,
because I don't want some exciting idea I have for a future post to be
accompanied by potential barriers to its production.
I want to feel like I can run with an idea without having
to determine if its realization clears some neglected hurdle to determine if it is "worth it".

 is that if I don't, 
there probably won't be a site for very much longer.
