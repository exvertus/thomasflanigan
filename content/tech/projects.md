Title: Projects

### Current

* [thomasflanigan.com](https://github.com/exvertus/thomasflanigan) - The code for this website.
* [Tom's Services](https://github.com/exvertus/services) - Kubernetes configuration for my internal services domain behind Google IAP that I use to access my Jenkins and a Discord bot shared among friends.

### Next up

* DirectoryIndexes - Pelican plugin that further divides articles and pages according to their relative-paths in the content folder. Also enables custom index.html's at each folder level.
* 2nd-Dimension - Custom Pelican theme heavily inspired by the html5up Dimension theme. This is the "2nd" Dimension in that Dimension is a single index theme, but this can be combined with the DirectoryIndexes plugin to add sub-index pages.
