Title: Tech

Interested in hiring me?  
  
Then you are saying you'd like to pull me away from spending time with my partner and cats...  
making art, music, writing posts and poems...  
and doing *my own* tech work that will grow *my* businesses?  
  
Start by *fully* understanding I will never view selling my soul to your corporation as a means of self-fulfillment.  
Anyone who lives with such expectations is a capital 'L' Loser and I do everything in my power to avoid such energy.  
Nor am I willing to spend time jumping through hoops in your interview process to make assessing my skillset easier on you.  
Are you really going to white-board test me on something before you've even asked or looked at my github?  
  
If you have not taken the time to read this, and you fail to provide me with a clear picture of how working for you will allow me to continue investing time in my passions in a mutually beneficially arrangement, you will not recieve a response.
