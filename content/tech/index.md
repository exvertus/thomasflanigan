Title: Tech

Interested in hiring me?  
So you are saying you are interested in pulling me away from...  
  
* Drawing?  
* Making music?  
* Writing?  
* Doing *my own* tech work that will make *me* rich instead of you?  
  
Then you might want to start working on your sales pitch instead of assuming I've been waiting my whole life sell my soul to your corporation.
