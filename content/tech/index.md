Title: Tech

I take a lot of pride in the execellence I have shown consistently  
in a variety of functions over ten years---application developer,  
pipeline automator, scrum master, mentor and even class lecturer/instructor.  
When integrated with a team, I take a 'people and process first' approach  
because I know trust is crucial to asking tough questions and healthy debate.  
I balance this with a momentum-based hyper-focus mode where I can accomplish  
challenging and complex technical projects in a suprisingly short timeframe.
