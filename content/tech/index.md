Title: Tech

I take pride in the consistent execellence I have shown wearing  
a variety of hats over ten years---  
application developer, pipeline automator, scrum master,  
mentor and even class lecturer/instructor.  

When integrated with a team, I take a 'people and process first' approach.  
Respect and trust is crucial for the room to to ask tough questions and 
foster healthy debate about the direction of the product.  
I balance this with a momentum-based hyper-focus mode where I can quickly  
aquire new skills and complete challenging technical projects independently.
