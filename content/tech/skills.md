Summary: Tom Flanigan Skills

### Soft skills

When integrated with a team, I take a 'people and process first' approach.
Respect and trust is crucial for the team to ask tough questions and foster healthy debate about the direction of the product.
I balance this with a momentum-based, hyper-focus mode where I can quickly
acquire new skills and complete challenging technical projects independently.
