### Soft skills and work-style

I take a 'people and process first' approach when integrating with a team and actively promote an environment where everyone feels respect, trust, and patience toward one another.
I believe firmly that room for harmonious conflict is critical: team members feel comfortable asking tough questions, express important concerns early and often, and graceful criticism without wounding becomes possible.

While I am a poet and occassionally write metaphorically (and will sprinkle some gifs and emojis in my chats), I am mostly precise, polite and concise with my written communication on technical projects.  

I am just as strong a verbal communicator.
As a emphathetic and comprehensive listener, I practice the Dale Carnegie approach when speaking with others. 

A well-functioning team does not require everyone be best friends (although I do value the strong "outside work" relationships I've gained through technical collaboration). Nor do they need to routinely exist in the same physical space, but the team does require strong ongoing mutual respect and I believe deeper conversation with potential for back-and-forth works best over regular video communication.
I am happy to make myself available for video communication within clearly defined time windows. 
I have learned designated office hours are best to balance with distraction-free time for my "communicate with the computer" work.  
  
This awareness also is important in how I am able to manage my time well indepedently. It does come with a few caveats that makes me a better fit for some teams over others. I have a neurological disability that is blessing if I am given the room to follow my strict time-management rules I have developed for myself.  

I use a 25/5 Pomodoro strategy for shallow work and a hyper-focus mode for deep work, where I can quickly acquire new skills and apply them to complete larger challenging technical projects in bursts of heightened productivity.
These bursts are momentum-based and can involve over an hour warmup period to get in the zone, but I can become locked in for an extended period of elevated flow.
More can be understood about the benefits and limitations of my hyperfocusing [here](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-symptoms-hyperfocus-attention/).  

For complex or poorly defined problems that take multiple days to solve, it is common for novel, elegant and complete solutions to come to me subconsciously after investing time hyper-focused, and I take pride in the results when I am granted the flexibility to plunge into deep work.  

My productivity can otherwise become cursed in constant-interuption or high-micromanagement environments. I am flexible to come into an office every so often, but my productivity is severely impaired by an ongoing in-office requirement.
