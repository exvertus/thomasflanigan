### Soft skills and work-style

I take a 'people and process first' approach when integrating with a team.
Although I have developed several strong "outside work" friendships through technical collaboration, I do not expect a well-functioning team requires everyone be best friends.
An environment where everyone feels strong respect, trust, and patience toward one another is however *absolutely necessary*.
It creates room for harmonious conflict: team members feel comfortable asking tough questions, express important concerns early and often, and graceful criticism without wounding becomes possible.  
  
While I am a poet and occassionally write metaphorically (and will sprinkle some gifs and emojis in my chats), I am mostly precise, polite and concise with my written communication on technical projects.  

I am just as strong a verbal communicator.
As a comprehensive and emphathetic listener I believe deeper conversation with potential for back-and-forth works best over video or in-person.
I am happy to make myself available for verbal communication, but that availability works best as structured office hours to balance time for my "communicate with the computer" work.  
  
I have a neurological disability that is blessing if I am given the room to follow my strict time-management rules I have developed for myself.  

I use a 25/5 Pomodoro strategy for shallow work and a hyper-focus mode for deep work, where I can quickly acquire new skills (I love learning!) and complete larger challenging technical projects in a short burst.
These bursts are momentum-based and can involve over an hour warmup period, but I can become locked in for an extended period of high-productivity once I am fully hyper-focused.  

For complex or poorly defined problems that take multiple days to solve, it is common for novel, elegant and complete solutions to come to me subconsciously after investing time hyper-focused and I always take pride in the results when I am granted this flexibility.  

My productivity can otherwise become cursed in constant-interuption and high-micromanagement environments and it is severely impaired by an in-office requirement.
