### Soft skills and work-style

I take a 'people and process first' approach when integrating with a team and actively promote an environment where everyone feels respect, trust, and patience toward one another.
I believe firmly that room for harmonious conflict is critical: team members feel comfortable asking tough questions, express important concerns early and often, and graceful criticism without wounding becomes possible.

While I am a poet and occassionally write metaphorically (and will sprinkle some gifs and emojis in my chats), I am mostly precise, polite and concise with my written communication on technical projects.  

I am just as strong a verbal communicator.
As a emphathetic and comprehensive listener, I practice the Dale Carnegie approach to interacting with others. 

A well-functioning team does not require everyone be best friends (although I do value the strong "outside work" relationships I've gained through technical collaboration) or routinely exist in the same physical space, but it does require strong ongoing mutual respect and I believe deeper conversation with potential for back-and-forth works best over regular video communication.
I am happy to make myself available for video communication with clearly defined time windows. 
I have learned designated office hours are best to balance with distraction-free time for my "communicate with the computer" work.  
  
This awareness also is important in how I am able to manage my time well indepedently. It does come with a few caveats that makes me a better fit for some teams over others. I have a neurological disability that is blessing if I am given the room to follow my strict time-management rules I have developed for myself.  

I use a 25/5 Pomodoro strategy for shallow work and a hyper-focus mode for deep work, where I can quickly acquire new skills and apply them to complete larger challenging technical projects in bursts of hightened-productivity.
These bursts are momentum-based and can involve over an hour warmup period to get in the zone, but I can become locked in for an extended period of elevated flow once I am fully hyper-focused.
More can be understood about the benefits and limitations of hyperfocusing [here](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-symptoms-hyperfocus-attention/).  

For complex or poorly defined problems that take multiple days to solve, it is common for novel, elegant and complete solutions to come to me subconsciously after investing time hyper-focused and I always take pride in the results when I am granted this flexibility.  

My productivity can otherwise become cursed in constant-interuption and high-micromanagement environments and it is severely impaired by an in-office requirement.
