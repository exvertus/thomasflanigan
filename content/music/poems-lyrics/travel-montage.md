Moving forward always  
right to left, over map  
  
Falling down the hallways  
drifting sites, halt to nap  
  
Worm that winds through nations  
or parabolic through the air  
  
Reach our destination  
yet here we are still in this square  
  
Oh how Sysiphian!  
We have not moved. Why did we stride?  
  
Stop! No time for questionsâ€”  
a train to catch! Enjoy the ride.
