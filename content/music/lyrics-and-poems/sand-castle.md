##### Sand Castle

How was it that I entered here?  
The first few rooms I donâ€™t recall,  
Did I carve them, or did they me?  
The path I take to birth the walls  

Cathedral Cave, my own design,  
Eyes multiply and I perceive,  
Unfolding edge gnaws mystery,  
May make it grow but never leave  

From inside, a separate world,  
Yet from outside, only grain,  
Parts to whole, or whole to parts,  
Cruel mirage consumed by rain
