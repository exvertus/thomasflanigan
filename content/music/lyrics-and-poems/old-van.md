Met a huge family with a huge van
it was a long time ago
can only recall it like a dream now
but they were real
  
They had just fixed the thing
it wasn’t the first time
She had been leaking oil again
engine graduated to coin-operated
  
The frame was stacked corn-flakes
some kids starting plucking them 
poking through the sharp hole
which slowly grew in the way-back
  
They had their doubts but wanted to keep her
cost wasn’t an issue
most of the children only knew her
there were so many they could not reach an agreement
  
I wanted to tell them to buy a new one
but I wasn’t in the family
could not grab worth it
  
  
  
  
but I could and would if they still drive it now
